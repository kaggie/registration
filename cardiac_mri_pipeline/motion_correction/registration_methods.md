Motion correction in 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for mitigating artifacts caused by patient motion, which can degrade image quality. 

    Retrospective Motion Correction  
        Description: Adjusts for motion after data acquisition by estimating motion parameters and correcting the k-space data or reconstructed images.  
        Techniques:  
            Navigator Echoes: Use additional low-resolution k-space data (navigators) to track motion. Navigators are interleaved with imaging data to estimate rigid-body motion (translations, rotations).  
            Image Registration: Aligns reconstructed 3D volumes using rigid or non-rigid registration algorithms (e.g., mutual information, B-splines).  
            K-Space Regridding: Corrects motion-induced phase errors in k-space by regridding data based on estimated motion parameters.
        Use with Limited K-Space: Navigator echoes can be acquired sparsely, reducing scan time while still providing motion estimates.
    Prospective Motion Correction  
        Description: Adjusts the MRI acquisition in real-time to compensate for motion during scanning.  
        Techniques:  
            Real-Time Tracking: Uses external devices (e.g., optical cameras, MRI-compatible trackers) or navigator echoes to update the imaging field of view (FOV) dynamically.  
            Adaptive Sequence Adjustment: Modifies gradient and RF pulses to align the imaging plane with the moving anatomy.  
            PROMO (Prospective Motion Correction): Uses navigator data to update the acquisition geometry in real-time for rigid-body motion.
        Use with Limited K-Space: Sparse navigators or low-resolution k-space data can provide sufficient motion information for real-time updates.
    Compressed Sensing-Based Motion Correction  
        Description: Leverages compressed sensing (CS) to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data, which is useful when motion corrupts parts of k-space.  
        Techniques:  
            Sparse Reconstruction: Uses sparsity constraints (e.g., total variation, wavelet transforms) to recover images from motion-corrupted, undersampled k-space.  
            Motion-Compensated CS: Incorporates motion models into the CS reconstruction to account for motion-induced inconsistencies.
        Use with Limited K-Space: CS inherently works with undersampled data, making it ideal for scenarios with limited k-space acquisition due to motion or time constraints.
    Self-Navigated Motion Correction  
        Description: Extracts motion information directly from the imaging k-space data without additional navigators.  
        Techniques:  
            PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping Parallel Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction): Acquires k-space in rotating blades, allowing motion estimation from overlapping central k-space regions.  
            BUTTERFLY: A variant of PROPELLER that uses radial sampling to estimate motion from central k-space.  
            CLOVER (Circular Low-Resolution Sampling): Uses circular k-space trajectories to estimate motion from low-resolution data.
        Use with Limited K-Space: These methods rely on redundant sampling of the central k-space, making them robust for motion correction with limited data.
    Deep Learning-Based Motion Correction  
        Description: Uses neural networks to predict motion parameters or correct motion artifacts directly in k-space or image domains.  
        Techniques:  
            Motion Estimation Networks: Train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate motion parameters from k-space or image data.  
            Artifact Correction Networks: Use generative models (e.g., GANs, U-Nets) to remove motion artifacts from corrupted images.  
            K-Space Interpolation: Train networks to interpolate missing or corrupted k-space data based on learned patterns.
        Use with Limited K-Space: Deep learning models can be trained on undersampled k-space data to predict full k-space or motion-corrected images.
    Parallel Imaging with Motion Correction  
        Description: Combines parallel imaging (e.g., SENSE, GRAPPA) with motion correction to reconstruct images from undersampled k-space data while accounting for motion.  
        Techniques:  
            SENSE with Motion Models: Incorporates motion parameters into the sensitivity encoding framework.  
            GRAPPA with Motion Compensation: Adjusts k-space interpolation weights to account for motion-induced inconsistencies.
        Use with Limited K-Space: Parallel imaging inherently reduces k-space sampling requirements, and motion correction can be integrated to handle sparse data.
    Model-Based Motion Correction  
        Description: Uses mathematical models of motion (e.g., rigid, affine, or deformable) to correct k-space or image data.  
        Techniques:  
            Generalized Reconstruction by Inversion of Coupled Systems (GRICS): Models motion as a combination of rigid and non-rigid transformations, solved iteratively.  
            Iterative Motion Correction: Optimizes motion parameters and image reconstruction jointly using techniques like conjugate gradient descent.
        Use with Limited K-Space: Model-based methods can regularize reconstruction to handle missing k-space data by incorporating motion priors.
    External Tracking-Based Correction  
        Description: Uses external devices (e.g., optical cameras, respiratory belts) to track motion and feed it into the reconstruction process.  
        Techniques:  
            Optical Tracking: Tracks head motion with cameras and updates the imaging FOV.  
            Respiratory Gating: Uses external sensors to gate acquisition during stable motion periods.
        Use with Limited K-Space: External tracking reduces reliance on k-space navigators, allowing correction with sparse data.
